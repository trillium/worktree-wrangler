All notable changes to Worktree Wrangler will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **Force removal support for dirty worktrees** with `--force` or `-f` flag
- **Enhanced error messages** showing which files are modified or untracked when removal fails
- **Helpful suggestions** automatically recommend using `--force` when removal is blocked by uncommitted changes
- **Tab completion support** for `--force` and `-f` flags in the `--rm` command

### Changed
- `w --rm` command now accepts optional `--force` or `-f` flag: `w --rm <project> <worktree> [-f|--force]`
- Error handling improved to show git status output when worktree removal fails due to modifications
- Help text and usage messages updated to document the new force removal option

### Use Cases
- Remove worktrees with files created by setup scripts without manual cleanup
- Quickly clean up experimental worktrees without committing or stashing changes
- Force removal when MCP agents or automation tools create files immediately after worktree creation

### Examples
```bash
# Remove clean worktree (existing behavior)
w --rm massage_tracker feature-branch

# Remove dirty worktree with uncommitted changes (new feature)
w --rm massage_tracker feature-branch --force
w --rm massage_tracker feature-branch -f  # short form

# Enhanced error message when --force is needed
$ w --rm massage_tracker feature-branch
Error: Worktree contains modifications

Modified or untracked files:
 M package.json
?? node_modules/

Use --force to remove anyway:
  w --rm massage_tracker feature-branch --force
```

### Technical Details
- Flag parsing implemented with proper error handling for unknown options
- Git error output captured and analyzed to detect modification errors
- Colored output for better readability of error messages and suggestions
- Force flag passed directly to `git worktree remove --force` when specified
- Completion system updated to offer `--force` and `-f` as third argument options

## [1.5.0] - 2025-08-18

### 🔄 BREAKING CHANGE: Per-Repository Script Configuration

**MIGRATION REQUIRED**: Setup and archive scripts are now configured per-repository instead of globally.

### Added
- **Per-Repository Script Commands**:
  - `w <repo> --setup_script <path>` - Set setup script for specific repository
  - `w <repo> --archive_script <path>` - Set archive script for specific repository
  - `w <repo> --setup_script ""` - Clear setup script for repository
  - `w <repo> --archive_script ""` - Clear archive script for repository
- **Enhanced Configuration Display** - `w --config list` now shows all configured repository scripts with clear organization
- **Repository Validation** - Commands validate that the specified repository exists before configuring scripts
- **Improved Help Documentation** - Updated `--help` and `--config` to show new per-repository syntax

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Global script configuration (`w --config setup_script/archive_script`) is now **deprecated**
- Scripts are stored per-repository in `~/.local/share/worktree-wrangler/repos/` directory
- Each repository can have its own setup and archive scripts for maximum flexibility
- Configuration commands now provide clear migration guidance with examples

### Migration Guide
```bash
# OLD (deprecated):
w --config setup_script ~/scripts/setup.sh

# NEW (per-repository):
w myproject --setup_script ~/scripts/setup.sh
w frontend --setup_script ~/scripts/frontend-setup.sh
w backend --setup_script ~/scripts/backend-setup.sh
```

### Technical Details
- Repository scripts stored as individual files: `<repo>.setup_script` and `<repo>.archive_script`
- Same environment variables provided: `$W_WORKSPACE_NAME`, `$W_WORKSPACE_PATH`, `$W_ROOT_PATH`, `$W_DEFAULT_BRANCH`
- Backward compatibility maintained through deprecation warnings with migration examples
- Enhanced error handling with repository existence validation
